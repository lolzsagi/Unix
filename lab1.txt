Creating A Directory
1. "ls" command displays all the documents i.e., both files and directories in the system.
2. vim<filename.ext> => creates a text file
3. "gedit <filename.ext>" takes us into the text editor
4. To create a directory we use the command => mkdir<name>
5. "cd <dirname>" gets you into the directory dirname
